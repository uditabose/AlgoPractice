    I figured out how to get rich: online poker.

    I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles 
    cards by doing a single riffle.

    To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if 
    a full deck of cards shuffled_deck is a single riffle 
    of two other halves half1 and half2.

    We'll represent a stack of cards as a list of integers 
    in the range 1..521..52 (since there are 5252 distinct cards in a deck).
    Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely 
    random shuffle. If I'm right, I can make more informed 
    bets and get rich and finally prove to my ex that I am 
    not a "loser with an unhealthy cake obsession" 
    (even though it's too late now because she let me go 
    and she's never getting me back).
