def h_index(citations):
    '''
    Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative 
    integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute 
    the researcher's h-index.

    According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
    "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers 
    have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h 
    papers have no more than h citations each."

    Example:

    Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 
                 5 papers in total and each of them had 
                 received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3
                  citations each and the remaining 
                 two with no more than 3 citations each, 
                 her h-index is 3.
    Note: If there are several possible values for h, 
    the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
